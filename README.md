PhD thesis work on image alignment and feature tracking between images. PI: Nicole Karnath, direct adviser: Dan Watson, co-adviser: Alice Quillen

Publication(s): https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...948...39R/abstract and one in prep (Karnath + 2024)

Complex_Flows_361A: Work to be submitted for PI. Tested methods from 361C work further by fully mapping speeds of imaged features with the gradient image (Sobel's method). Traditionally called "optical flow", though this work is infrared...

PrecessingJetDynamics_361C: includes dynamical models and ratio images to determine physics properties of jets (e.g. speed, momentum, etc). Involved rescaling images and careful alignment to get proper motions.

Image_Alignment: various methods testing principles and steps of DrizzlePac.
